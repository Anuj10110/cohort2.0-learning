# Cohort 2.0 Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is my **personal learning tracker** for the **Cohort 2.0 batch of Sheryians Coding School**.

Instead of creating multiple folders, I continuously **update the existing files** as I learn new concepts — making this repo a living workspace that evolves with my skills.
